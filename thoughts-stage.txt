key words: annuaire d'agence ergonomic ,micro service , exposition api, getTheirPLaces,could work with the google api , user management (most likely would use key cloak for that) , interface administrateur, 

Proposed micro services: 
-Agence Management: for managing crud simple meta data 
-Agence location management : for managing just the location of agencys, could merge it with agence management as ill Always need to manage them both but diff√©rences  between tecknological uses and ubextruious langugae might justify this subdivision. 
-user management: could be replaced with a key cloack service, but might include a live tracking feature , considering subdivinding this feature into its own micro service.
